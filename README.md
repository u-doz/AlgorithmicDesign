First Homework:

1. implement the strassen matrix mult function to multiply two 2n × 2
n matrices by using the Strassen’s algorithm;

2. generalize strassen matrix mult to deal with any kind of matrix pair
that can be multiplied (possibly also non-square matrices) and prove that
the asymptotic complexity does not change;

3. improve the implementation of the function by reducing the number of
auxiliary matrices and test the effects on the execution time;

4. answer to the following question: how much is the minimum auxiliary
space required to evaluate the Strassen’s algorithm? Motivate the answer.
