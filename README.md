First Homework:

1. implement the strassen matrix mult function to multiply two 2n × 2
n matrices by using the Strassen’s algorithm;

2. generalize strassen matrix mult to deal with any kind of matrix pair
that can be multiplied (possibly also non-square matrices) and prove that
the asymptotic complexity does not change;

3. improve the implementation of the function by reducing the number of
auxiliary matrices and test the effects on the execution time;

4. answer to the following question: how much is the minimum auxiliary
space required to evaluate the Strassen’s algorithm? Motivate the answer.


Third Homework:

1. Implement the binary heap-based version of the Dijkstra’s algorithm.

2. Consider the contraction hierarchies presented during the course. Assume
to deal with graphs that can be fully represented in the memory of your
computer. Implement:

  (a) an algorithm to add the shortcuts to a graph;

  (b) a bidirectional version of Dijkstra algorithm that can operate on the
      graphs decorated by the algorithm at Point 2a.
